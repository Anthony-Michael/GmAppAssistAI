# AI GM Assistant - Final Delivery

## Project Overview
This document provides an overview of the AI GM Assistant mobile application that has been developed. The application is designed for Tabletop Role-Playing Game (TTRPG) Game Masters to reduce session preparation time and overcome creative blocks using AI-powered content generation.

## Project Structure
The application follows a standard React Native project structure with the following key directories:
